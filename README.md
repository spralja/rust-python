### Developing a compiler for the Python programming lanuguage that compiles to LLVM byte code in RUST.

problem formulation:
- Which subset of the python programming language (and programming languages in general) is it reasonable to create a compiler and optimiser for?
- Why are compilers for Python created?
- Is Rust a reasonable choice for creating compilers?
- Do the most widely used Python compilers encompass the entierty of the Python programming language, and if not why?
